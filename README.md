# Front End Masters

The title says it all: I gather every exercises from the [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) platform on this repo.

The listed courses are the one's I finished so far.

## Beginner Front End Dev Course 

You'll start with introduction to web development and deep dive into JavaScript, modern layout techniques in order to have the skills to be a professional web developer today.

### 1. Complete Intro to Web Development, v2

More than an introduction, in this course you’ll go from building your first website to having the foundation for becoming a professional web developer with modern skills! By coding along in this course, you'll get experience writing HTML, the primary language for putting content on a page. CSS, a language designed to make your websites look tidy and aesthetically pleasing. And learn how to program, starting with a wonderful language to learn with, JavaScript. After this whirlwind tour of web development, you'll know how to write code with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. You'll learn to use your terminal to save your code with Git and as a small bonus primer, you'll get a taste of how to use JavaScript via Node.js to serve your website from a server!

### 2. Getting Started with JavaScript, v2

Want to learn to code using JavaScript? This is a great place to start! In this course, you’ll start out with a tour of the basic building blocks programming like variables, loops, functions and operations. Then, you’ll go through the three main pillars of JavaScript: Types and Coercion for comparing values and converting between types, Scope and Closure for knowing where variables can be accessed, and JavaScript’s “this” and Prototype system for dynamic context.

### 3. CSS Grids and Flexbox for Responsive Web Design

Starting with a review of floats for context, but quickly moving into Flexbox and CSS grids, this essential course is for web developers that want to build responsive, beautiful web applications faster using less code and best practices. Master CSS Grid and Flexbox, the latest tools and tricks to layout beautiful, responsive web applications with less code.

### 4. JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2

A deep dive into JavaScript and functional programming techniques, this course is for beginner to intermediate JavaScript developers who want to learn techniques to write professional, modern JavaScript. In this course, Bianca cuts through the technical jargon to reveal the core concepts of JavaScript and applying functional programming techniques to JavaScript. Learn higher-order functions, closures, scope and the fundamentals necessary to use modern frameworks like React, Angular and Vue. You'll master key functional methods like map, reduce and filter ...plus promises and ES6+ asynchronous JavaScript!

### 5. Mastering Chrome Developer Tools v2

Go beyond console.log to master all the built-in tools available in Google’s Chrome Developer Tools to edit, debug, and profile your web applications! You'll learn to step through your code with the debugger, audit web page performance, debug Node.js, and remove “page jank” when a site isn’t keeping up.

## React

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

### 1. Complete Intro to React, v5

Learn to build real-world applications using modern React! Much more than an intro, you’ll start from the ground up, getting all the way to using the latest features in React, including hooks, effects, context, and portals. Throughout the course, you’ll piece together tools from the entire React ecosystem (like Reach Router) to build a full application to browse adoptable pets.

### 2. Intermediate React, v2

Learn to build scalable React applications using the latest tools and techniques available in the React ecosystem! This is a modular course where you can pick and choose the various pieces of the react ecosystem you want to learn. You’ll learn hooks in-depth, CSS-in-JS with emotion, increase performance with code splitting and server-side rendering, add TypeScript, test your app with Jest …and more!

### 3. Advanced React Patterns

Discover how to simplify your large React applications with advanced component patterns! In this course, Kent C. Dodds shows how to separate component logic, state and display properties to make your components more flexible and usable across large React applications. You'll learn patterns like Compound Components, Render Props, Prop Getters, Controlled Props, and how to take advantage of React’s new Context API to share state throughout the application. This course is for developers who have experience building React applications and desire to scale their applications with components that are both simpler and more flexible! 

### 4. Testing React Applications, v2

Learn to catch errors before they reach the end user with automated tests! Write maintainable tests for your React applications using the popular Jest testing framework. You'll also see how much of your code is covered in tests, test your React components with the react-testing library and write end-to-end tests with Cypress and the cypress-testing library. Join Kent and learn how to test your code in-depth. This course is for developers who want to gain confidence in shipping bug-free React applications to production!

### 5. Advanced State Management in React (feat. Redux and MobX)

Explore popular libraries to manage state including Flux, Redux, MobX, Redux Sagas, and more. Learning these patterns will help you leverage the best techniques for managing state in your React applications!

## Conclusion

This is a really great way to introduce me to Front End Dev. It is also helping me a lot to keep learning and improving my skills.
